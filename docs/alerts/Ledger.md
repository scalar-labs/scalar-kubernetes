# Ledger Alerts

## LedgerClusterDown

This is the most critical alert and indicates that an Ledger cluster is not able to process requests. This alert should be handled with the highest priority.

### Example Alert

#### Firing

```
[FIRING:1] LedgerClusterDown - critical
Alert: Ledger cluster is down - critical
 Description: Ledger cluster is down, no resquest can be process.
 Details:
  • alertname: LedgerClusterDown
  • deployment: prod-scalardl-ledger
```

#### Resolved

```
[RESOLVED] LedgerClusterDown - critical
Alert: Ledger cluster is down - critical
 Description: Ledger cluster is down, no resquest can be process.
 Details:
  • alertname: LedgerClusterDown
  • deployment: prod-scalardl-ledger
```

### Action Needed

* Check the number of replicas set `kubectl get deployments. prod-scalardl-ledger`
* Check the number of replicas set `kubectl describe deployments. prod-scalardl-ledger`
* Check nodes statuses with `kubectl get node -o wide`
* Check the log server to pinpoint the root cause of a failure with kubernetes logs on the monitor server `/log/kubernetes/<year>/<month>-<day>/kube.log`
* Check a cloud provider to see if there is any known issue. For example, you can check statues [here](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status) in Azure.

## LedgerClusterDegraded

This alert lets you know if a kubernetes cluster cannot start ledger pods, which means that the cluster does not have enough resource or lost of one or many kubernetes nodes to run the deployment.

### Example Alert

#### Firing

```
[FIRING:1] LedgerClusterDegraded - warning
Alert: Ledger cluster is running in a degraded mode - warning
 Description: Ledger cluster is running in a degraded mode, some of the Ledger pods are not healthy.
 Details:
  • alertname: LedgerClusterDegraded
  • deployment: prod-scalardl-ledger
```

#### Resolved

```
[RESOLVED] LedgerClusterDegraded - warning
Alert: Ledger cluster is running in a degraded mode - warning
 Description: Ledger cluster is running in a degraded mode, some of the Ledger pods are not healthy.
 Details:
  • alertname: LedgerClusterDegraded
  • deployment: prod-scalardl-ledger
```

### Action Needed

* Check the log server to pinpoint the root cause of a failure with kubernetes logs on the monitor server `/log/kubernetes/<year>/<month>-<day>/kube.log`
* Check kubernetes deployment with `kubectl describe deployments prod-scalardl-ledger`
* Check replica set with `kubectl get replicasets.apps`
* Check nodes statuses with `kubectl get node -o wide`
* Check a cloud provider to see if there is any known issue. For example, you can check statues [here](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status) in Azure.

## LedgerPodsPending

This alert lets you know if a kubernetes cluster cannot start ledger pods, which means that the cluster does not have the enough resource.

### Example Alert

#### Firing

```
[FIRING:1] LedgerPodsPending - warning
Alert: Pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy in namespace default in pending status - warning
 Description: Pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy in namespace default has been in pending status for more than 1 minute.
 Details:
  • alertname: LedgerPodsPending
  • deployment: prod-scalardl-ledger
```

#### Resolved

```
[RESOLVED:1] LedgerPodsPending - warning
Alert: Pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy in namespace default in pending status - warning
 Description: Pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy in namespace default has been in pending status for more than 1 minute.
 Details:
  • alertname: LedgerPodsPending
  • deployment: prod-scalardl-ledger
```

### Action Needed

* Check log server to pinpoint root cause of failure with the kubernetes logs on the monitor server `/log/kubernetes/<year>/<month>-<day>/kube.log`
* Check the kubernetes deployment with `kubectl describe pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy`

## LedgerPodsError

This alert lets you know if a kubernetes cluster cannot start ledger pods for one of the following reasons:

* CrashLoopBackOff
* CreateContainerConfigError
* CreateContainerError
* ErrImagePull
* ImagePullBackOff
* InvalidImageName

### Example Alert

#### Firing

```
[FIRING:1] LedgerPodsError - warning
Alert: Pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy in namespace default has an error status - warning
 Description: Pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy in namespace default has been in pending status for more than 1 minutes.
 Details:
  • alertname: LedgerPodsError
  • deployment: prod-scalardl-ledger
```

#### Resolved

```
[RESOLVED:1] LedgerPodsError - warning
Alert: Pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy in namespace default has an error status - warning
 Description: Pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy in namespace default has been in pending status for more than 1 minutes.
 Details:
  • alertname: LedgerPodsError
  • deployment: prod-scalardl-ledger
```

### Action Needed

* Check the kubernetes deployment with `kubectl describe pod prod-scalardl-ledger-xxxx-yyyy`
* Check log server to pinpoint root cause of failure with the kubernetes logs on the monitor server `/log/kubernetes/<year>/<month>-<day>/kube.log`
